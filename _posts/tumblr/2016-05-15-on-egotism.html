<p>Egotism: the feeling or belief that you are better, more important, more talented, etc., than other people <br/></p><p>Source: Merriam-Webster’s Learner’s Dictionary <br/></p><hr><p>I truly believe that egotism along with some other devastating traits of human mind has been the leading reason for individual misery and also an obstacle in the advancement of our community as a whole. It’s egotism that’s when not checked, can develop into other prejudiced emotions which works collectively like jingoism and chauvinism. People often confuse egotism with self-respect but self-respect and confidence needn’t forced down people’s throats. Self confidence is candid and fearless whereas egotism is afraid. Self confidence fuels humility while egotism mislabels it as weakness. </p><p>Throughout mankind’s existence, all the wars and killings could’ve been easily avoided if it wasn’t for egotism and insecurities. They all collectively believed that they’re somewhat superior than their enemies and if the enemy disregard to acknowledge it, they shouldn’t exist. From religious chauvinism to patriarchy, from over exaggerated patriotism to racism, man’s inflated ego has been counter-balancing his significant accomplishments. We have created weapons of mass destruction out of our feeling of superiority. We have wiped out entire species from the planet in our ignorance.</p><p>But that’s all on grand scale, what I’d like to discuss today is how egotism is truly the final boss in our pursuit of self improvement 

and we’ve to fight it. I can talk about egotism with such familiarity because I’ve seen it up close and personally - inside myself.</p><p>Normally, I am quite a humble guy who knows where he stands and respects others for what they are. But I have my insecurities and when these insecurities materialize, I get defensive and what better way to defend yourself than putting yourself on a pedestal and convincing yourself that you are better than others and they have no right to point out faults in you. You start to disregard all of their qualities and start to see them as mere existence, lacking all emotional and cognitive faculties. Humility comes from experience and egotism comes from ignorance. I have realized that in times of such ignorance I’ve hurt myself and missed some great opportunities which would’ve made me a little bit better person than I am today. And all this is not an epiphany rather it was a gradual realization and I learned all this whenever I achieved something. It’s curious that I felt humble when I had actually done something of worth. So the conclusion I drew from this was that you have to feel good about yourself to become unpresuming. You have to feel confident in your skin to shirk away the petty and dishonest criticisms and to welcome the sincere ones. But there is an exception to all this as well. It is quite evident that there are people out there who are also insecure and they will throw unnecessary condemnation at you and you have to be wise enough to recognize them. The best way is not to acknowledge such criticism and avoid getting provoked. </p><p>A similar incident happened with me recently where I was confused about my own behavior. I was not sure whether I was being an egotist or a self-respecting individual. There was some misunderstanding among some friends and I went out of my way to straighten things out. But then I realized that sometimes people are not ready to invest themselves enough to save a relationship as much as I am. I eventually gave up because if I had tried even more, I might have projected myself as needy or weak and that was also not desirable for the purpose, which was, to save the relationship. Such incidences leave you feeling sad and lost as I am feeling right now because I think emotions like egotism are very primitive and if I am unable to get rid of them in my immediate surrounding, I am not so much evolved over this emotions myself. Sometimes everything is not in your hands and you have to let go of some things. Perhaps we are not evolved enough to get completely rid of these primitive feelings. We have a long way to go.</p>
