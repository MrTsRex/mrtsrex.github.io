<p>Just finished watching Dexter Season 8. The show I really loved, is now over. I was never into crime shows, but something about Dexter really grabbed my attention six years back, when I started watching it. May be it was the lead character himself, Dexter Morgan that made me watch it. I somehow felt connected to him. I don’t know why as I’m not a psychopath and certainly not a serial killer. But I guess psychopaths and sociopaths have lot in common and I consider myself possessing quite a few traits of the latter. In one of the episodes of Sherlock (Yeah, I do watch a lot of T.V.), Sherlock corrects one of the character who is accusing him of being a psychopath by admitting that he is a highly functional sociopath. A psychopath is one who lacks empathy, is highly violent, can’t maintain a relationship, and are, impulsive. Whereas a sociopath is one who is controlled, antisocial but occasionally charming, moderately violent, manipulator and whatnot. They both are dangerous and criminal. Enough bragging, the truth is I’m just a nerd lacking social graces, but having a fancy term to describe yourself seems badass and cool. And it is easy to blame everything that’s wrong with you on something that others can’t understand. So yeah, I started watching Dexter and loved everything about it, but this post is not about the show (seriously), I’m gonna write a whole new bigass article on that, but this is not it. So I started watching Dexter in 2008 and I saw the last episode today and it made me cry. Seems alright for someone who is following a show for six years and when it concludes with an emotional ending. Well, that was not it. Yeah I was totally in love with the show and wanted it to run forever, but I had felt similar for other shows and cartoons as well but they didn’t made me cry. Atleast not in past four years.</p>
<p>It was four years back when I took a stupid decision and decided not cry ever. I was going through really tough time and thought, crying is for pussies and crying is not gonna solve anything and stuff  like that so why not give up crying and become the manliest man ever (Well, something like that). Haven’t I mentioned that it wasn’t the wisest of the decisions I’ve made (Sarcasm, I’m good at it). Suppressing your emotions is never a good idea. I’m not saying always agree to your emotional self but you shouldn’t ignore him or in my case beat him to death. It will leave you cold. And that’s what happened with me. In the past four years I always felt like I was carrying some unnecessary burden. I have been trying to cry for some past few weeks but I was so cold it was no help. I was down to only one option to go to a Dementor who would make me remember my worst memories (Harry Potter reference), and eventually make me cry. But something happened today while watching that last episode that triggered Niagara falls through my eyes. And I’m very thankful. I think crying is like masturbation for your soul. You shouldn’t overdo it but you should do it occasionally to release that pent up energy that could fuck you up from inside. The whole point of writing all this is, we should never suppress our feelings. It&rsquo;s not just about crying, but goes with every strong emotion we feel. We should let it all out without caring what others will think of us. I learned it the hard way. Now I think, I’m being overly emotional as I never write blog post or even a diary. But fuck it, I don’t care anymore and actually there’s nobody to read it so my secret’s safe with me. But you would never know what could happen over internet, maybe some day, a brave voyager stumbles upon my ship (This blog, sorry for shitty references) and explores my treasures (My Posts), so to that brave voyager, Thank you sir for reading.</p>
