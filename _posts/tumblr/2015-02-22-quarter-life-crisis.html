<p>I am a terrible person. Now I am getting a feeling that the reason why I am so miserable is that I am not a good human being. People around me are just tagging along and bearing me and that’s why they don’t like me. But when I look around, when I go out, they surprise me again. They prove to me that I am not the most horrible person around. They lead me by miles. But if they’re all bad, why they look so happy together. Are they pretending? Are they really happy? Do bad people stay happy together? I know that nobody is downright bad or crazy or evil. We all have a little evil and good in us. And we’ve been hearing this for centuries that it’s on us who we choose to be. Well I chose to be good. And I also choose to be liked. Ohhhh. Here’s the problem. Eureka. I’ve found it. Apparently you can’t be good all the way and be liked by everyone. I’ve tried it. You can’t please everybody. That’s a fact. However good your intentions were, somebody somewhere is going to hate you for your deed. So what should we do. Well does it look like a post having answers. I have no idea. I am just so confused. People around me like to show off. Even the people I like. And to make them like me back, I got to do the same. But I am already so messed up as is. I’ve tweaked my personality so much for the last few years that I don’t know who the real me is. Maybe that’s the problem people around me are facing as well. Maybe they want to like me but they are confused too. They aren’t able to see through me. And by people I mean mostly girls, because I have a lot of guy friends, real ones. Because they know the real me. So the real me is likeable. So I should stop pleasing people. I should be just the way I am. Okay, but these girls and these people don’t like a somewhat artistic, somewhat funny, somewhat nice, somewhat good-looking, somewhat introvert, somewhat extrovert, somewhat intelligent fella who does not want to hurt anyone but help them. They don’t care. I don’t mean that these people are bad. They’ve just brought all the fake in them together and now they are all a bunch of pretenders. The good in them is lying about in some corner and can only be seen when you are with them alone. So in return what these pretenders demand? Well they want to be around someone who can give them a status. Make them a little famous in the local community, college, city etc. They demand someone who will never criticize them. They demand flattery. And if you can’t give them that, then you’re not invited to the party. </p>

<p>I am in the middle. I’ve made some tweaks and offered them flattery. I’ve tried to look “cool”. So I’ve been invited to a few parties. But now I am messed up as ever. I don’t know who I am anymore. This real beauty thing is a lie. Nobody cares about the inner beauty. Maybe some people do. But definitely not the prom queen. She doesn’t give a heck about inner beauty. And you are in real hell if you are in love with her and you are not that good looking and ‘cool’ per se. It would’ve been easier to move on if the prom queen is a terrible person. But what if she’s a nice person. What then? Then it’s hell for you. My problem is similar to the guy loving the prom queen. I like some girls but don’t know how to please them the right way. I want to know the right thing. Should I just move on and be miserable and non famous even when I deserve it? Should I focus on the real thing and work on brushing up my talent? Or should I continue to try harder, incorporate a little fake in me and make them like me? I don’t know.</p>
