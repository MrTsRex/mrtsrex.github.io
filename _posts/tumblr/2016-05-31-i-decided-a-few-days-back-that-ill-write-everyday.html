<p>I decided a few days back that I’ll write everyday and that It’ll be about the stuff I know. Turns out, I know very little and my knowledge is very subpar and it needs a lot of brushing up. Half assed knowledge is really dangerous and I need to stop studying stuff on the periphery as it gives you the satisfaction of knowing, you don’t actually know anything. </p>
