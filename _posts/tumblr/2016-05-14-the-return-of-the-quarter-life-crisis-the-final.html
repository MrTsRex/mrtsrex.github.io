<p>I am 22 years old and I have no pragmatic plan or have any idea what I want to do with the rest of my life. Well, I am not the only one to be facing this dilemma but the saving grace for some other people is that they have the luxury to find their true passion. And some other people have no hobbies or interests that they could pursue so they just let the circumstances drive their lives. But in my case, I don’t have time because I am about to graduate in a month and to have a decent life I have to choose between a Master’s or a job in my current field i.e., Computer Science. I like computers but do not like computer science enough to pursue it for the rest of my life. It might be an absurd demand to ask to do something you love. What about your parents who toiled away their entire life to get you a decent education? What about so many people in the world who just struggle to feed their family? Is is too much to ask for a job that you absolutely love? Is their something like your “true calling” or “passion” ? Or jobs and interests are two absolutely different things and we have to find a balance between these two? I have been asking this questions for as long as I remember and yet I am unable to answer them. I tried everything in my capacity to look for answers but perhaps because of my middle class background and limited resources, I am still as clueless as I ever was.</p><p>Now I have a crucial decision to make. I either have to go with my current education and do my best in the field where I can go for higher studies (I had applied to graduate schools in USA and secured an admission in University of Florida with scholarship) or leave it all behind and start anew to find my calling. It is going to be the most important decision of my life and has the capacity to shape my entire future. I faced something similar but not of this degree a few years back after my high school. I was sucking at school (Partly because of my parents’ stupid decisions and partly because of my decisions) so I decided to join a Cricket club because at that time I loved playing cricket and loved the idea of making it big in it. Through the course of my short term tenure at the club I realized that I am good but not good enough to fulfill my dreams. Sounds like a quitter’s excuse but in fact it was true. I joined the club at the age of 16 and most of the people who had any scope in the real world were playing since they were 5. I am small dude and I wanted to become a Bowler for which one of the most important requirement was to be Tall. All the odds were against me. I realized that either I keep doing this for years to come and secure a position at the local team if I am lucky or just drop the idea and look for something where I can be really good and where my chance can improve over time if i persisted. I dropped out of club and started studying. </p><p>One thing about me is I do not have one singular hobby but a myriad of them. This is the lovely fucked up trait that creating all the fuzz in my life. I watched a Ted talk where the speaker referred to people like me as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJORi5VO1F8"><b><i>“Multipotentialite”</i></b></a>. If the speaker of the Ted talk to be believed, I don’t have to find my one true calling, but do something awesome with all my interests combined together. Perhaps I’ll do that.There are bankers, investors and people who apparently have boring jobs yet they don’t complain because they’re getting paid. Most of them don’t have any hobbies so they are quite okay with their current situation. They occasionally ask questions but the questions don’t keep them awake at night and make them withdraw from a career where they can have a luxurious life. I just requested for a deferral for my admission to UFL to next Fall.</p><p>In next one year I am planning to find something I am okay to do for atleast for the next 10 years that follow. If I am unable to find anything, I’ll go to UFL to study and get a high paying job where I’ll be able to easily pay my student loan (I’ll need a loan to study there). I haven’t explored the field of Computer Science enough to reject it altogether. I’ll study that as well. I have secured a job in my campus job fair so I’ll join the company because staying at home is not an option (My parents and the Society wont let me stay home and “think”). I am looking for internships for my interests and if I find one, I am definitely applying for it. All this is not because I am just taking myself too seriously but just that I want to be content for once in my life. I hope to lord and the god who I totally don’t believe in to give me strength so that I can get my shit straight.</p><p><br/></p><p>P.S. : I am writing this post because writing is one of my hobbies and I want to see if it is remotely possible for me to have somewhat a career in it. So from now on I’ll write one post everyday, kind of a diary entry but not about what I did throughout the day but what I thought. This blog is going to face some serious literary and emotional vomit.</p><p>Links :<b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJORi5VO1F8">Ted Talk video </a></b></p>
