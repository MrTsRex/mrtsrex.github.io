<p><b>-MrTsRex</b><br/></p><hr><p>This
is a story of a pig. A pig who could think. I don’t know if pigs
could think but pigs in this story definitely can. Well, at least one them can.
In this story I am going to anthropomorphise various animals and the
reason I am telling you all this is because I am a terrible writer
and can’t employ clever writing techniques to deliver it subtly. I
am also very honest. This is your last chance to stop reading this
story because after this point you’ll have to read till the end,
otherwise you’ll go to hell and Satan himself will pour lava into
your rectum. Also it’ll hurt my feelings.</p><p>You
are still reading. So here we go. This is a story about a young male
pig. Pigs don’t have names so we’ll call him just pig, our pig.
So our pig had just come of age in pig years and was seriously
confused and concerned about the condition of the world he’s living
in. He’s a pig living in a developing country where pigs still have
the freedom to roam around and eat bellyful of their favorite shit.
He likes that about his life. Eating shit off the streets and later
guessing which animal it belonged to, taking a long nice bath in the
puddle and later rubbing their ass against the corner of a building,
scavenging through garbage dump, these are some of the guilty
pleasures our pig and his brethren enjoy. But as I’ve mentioned
earlier, at least one of the pigs in this story could think, well
it’s none other then our own pig. He didn’t know how he had
developed this ability. In the beginning it was wonderful,
enlightening, other worldly, almost orgasmic feeling, but later on,
the side effects of this ability presented themselves. The side
effect started with the loss of interest in the everyday frolicking.
The oink-oink battles and raping the older female pigs lost its
charm. It just felt weird, pig weird (which is the worst weird there
is). 
</p><p>Other
pigs started noticing our little pig’s detachment and called him
out over it. Out of fear of being ostracized, our pig started
pretending. He joined the pigs for the everyday madness, ate through
the bins, fucked females for the show and rubbed his ass wherever he
could. None of this made sense to him. Yes, he was trying to make
sense out of the world. Stupid little fuck. 
</p><p>This
pretension was killing our pig from the inside and he tried even
harder to find the answers. Little shit eater didn’t know that
ignorance was a bliss, that he took for granted. But he knew enough
that he couldn’t go back now. He started noticing. He started
seeing. Pigs or any animal for that matter always knew that they have
a certain place in the world which was above or below the other
animals. They kind of knew implicitly that they are a part of a
hierarchy and have to follow certain rules to survive. Pigs aren’t
exactly a cowardly species but they know who to not mess with. Humans
were the most dangerous of them all. You don’t mess with the
upright standers. If they want your hairs, you oink out your pain and
let them do whatever they want with you. You don’t fight them, you
don’t bite them. Next came the dogs. But there were two factions of
dogs. One accompanied by humans and the others were the fellow street
dwellers. The human accompanied dogs were stronger but minded their
own business most of the time. The street dwellers were the bunch of
assholes. The pigs had their skirmishes with the dogs everyday over
something or the other but they had devised their own way to coexist
in the neighborhood. The dogs always looked for the pregnant pigs and
hunted for the piglets in packs or solo whenever they got a chance.
And most of the time, they caught a piglet or two because it was the
lone mother pig versus the dogs. Pigs never defended against such
hunts and it had became a part of their lives. Our pig’s been
watching this pattern all his life and it made him furious how nobody
defended their own. He once asked a strong pig why he never fought
the dogs, and the strong pig replied casually that it’s the way of
the world and you have to follow certain rules. He said that it’s
not his problem and he never saw the female pigs complaining. He said
that it’s better this way as pigs give birth to a big litter and
it’s good that some of them died, less competition for us he said,
with a chuckle like oink. He advised our pig to mind his own
business. Our pig never asked any other pig about such things from
then on.</p><p>Our
pig understood by now that some of us are born lucky. Being born in a
certain specie gave them advantages. Just because the stupid dogs can
wag their tails and lick their own balls, they were higher in the
hierarchy. The way certain animal looked also mattered a lot. Our pig
knew that pigs are not the most attractive animals. Our pig tried to
wag his tail at some humans and instead of getting treats, he got
stones thrown at him. He started to hate dogs even more. He started
observing the dogs and humans. Humans were really tough to
understand. None of the theories fit their actions. They were just
beyond our pigs understanding. He observed the dogs. He soon found
out that the privileges the dogs are getting has nothing to do with
intelligence. Pigs were certainly more intelligent than dogs. What
made the difference was the level of complaisance. Pigs never gave a
fuck whether the humans liked them or not. Dogs on the other hand
lived for it. 
</p><p>All
this knowledge was killing our pig. He was born and grew up in this
dump of a place they called home. He had no complaints before but now
he knew something was missing. He didn’t want to live this way.
There must be a place where pigs were living happily with dignity. There must
be a place where the humans didn’t intervene and dogs didn’t
bite. He thought that he’ll look for such a place some day. But he
had never left his home. Our pig was afraid.</p><p>Days
went by and our pig grew even bigger and stronger. Now the hate was
not limited to the dogs, he hated himself too. The helplessness was
infuriating for him. It was just unfair. The sheer vexation of it all
was unbearable. He was ready to take action now. He didn’t care
what happened to him. Our pig didn’t have to wait long before the
dogs made their move. They were attacking the newly born litter of
pigs. The mother pig was doing her best to save her children but the
dogs were too many. One of the dog isolated one piglet and was about
to incise his canines into the piglet when our pig bit the dog’s
rear leg. Our pig dragged the dog away from the piglet while the dog
was screaming like a bitch. Our pig almost tore the dog’s leg off.
Other dogs were watching this. They gave up their hunt and surrounded
our pig. Some of them started barking. Our Pig made a noise that
resembled the bark. As they saw themselves being mocked and their
companion’s leg getting ripped apart, a few came forward to fight
the pig themselves. Watching this, other dogs did the same and soon
all the hunting pack was fighting our pig. One dog bit our pigs tail
and pulled at it. Half of the tail ripped away from our pigs body and
the dog stared wailing in triumph. Watching this, other dogs also
leaped up on our pig and started grabbing different body parts to
tear away. By now, our pig was in great pain and he realized that he
couldn’t possibly take on this lot alone. With all his remaining
might, our pig pulled himself away from the dogs. Lot of his skin and
ears were dangling in the dogs’ jaws. He didn’t wait to assess
the damage but started to run. He ran as his life was depended on it.
Well it was. He ran and ran and ran some more. He ran until he
couldn’t see. And after a while he fell unconscious.</p><p>When
he woke up he found himself in a queer place. Everything seemed quite
clean. There were no dumpsters around, no filth, no shit. There
weren’t any pigs either nor stray dogs. It was a ghastly image. The
pig knew that he has come to a wrong part of the town. He tried to
get up but as soon as he got up, excruciating pain ran through his
entire body and he collapsed back again. The long unconsciousness had
made his body numb and when he got up, every bone, nerve and sinew
came back to life and in a millisecond his brain was notified of the
damage his body had taken. He moved his head in agony and looked at
his body. There were teethmarks everywhere, some shallow some very
deep. He was bleeding profusely and there was a small puddle of blood
just beside his belly. He felt angry and stupid. This was not what he
wanted. It was the exact opposite of what he wanted. But it was his
choice. He blamed himself for making the stupid choice. The rebellion
was not worth the pain. And what did he achieve. The dogs were still
there, perhaps celebrating for dragging him away. The pigs too must
be laughing at him he thought, for he had just proved their point that not
to mess with order. He felt stupid and utterly defeated. He is a
failure he thought and believed that his life had ended. He waited
for his eventual death and fell asleep. He heard some noises and woke
up. He saw some humans screaming and running away. He
understood that it was not a good sign and with all his remaining
might started to drag himself away from there. After a while he heard
some loud noises. He looked back and saw some humans with big sticks
and it was the sticks that were making those noises. He increased his
pace but couldn’t run because of the pain. Suddenly something
struck him above his left hind leg. The humans were firing rubber
bullets from guns and one bullet hit our pig. Was it survival
instinct or was it some divine intervention, our pig suddenly felt
unusual energy and he started running. The noises didn’t stop and
he continued running. He ran again as his life depended on it and
this time he found himself in a jungle. He wasn’t being chased
anymore. But now he was mortally hurt. He was hungry too. He knew
that if he didn’t eat something now, he’ll definitely die. He
started eating nearby plants and after a while some of his senses
came back to him. He could smell dead meat. He followed the stench
and he came upon a dead carcass of a wolf. He ate it. He heard
something and followed the sound and this time it was a river. He
jumped in the river and felt like needles being pierced through his
body. The water was cold and his wounds were fresh. But
nonetheless, he felt alive. He felt like he had never felt before.
The pain didn’t bother him. He drank water while his wounds were
being washed by the river and after some time he got out. He limped
out of the river as his brain was again getting used to the pain and
he laid himself on the bank where some leaves had fallen from nearby
trees. 
</p><p>He
looked out to the river and the forest behind it. He looked at the
birds flying around. He felt the wind. It was not exactly what he had
in mind when he thought about pig utopia. He didn’t feel like winning. But he sure as hell didn’t
feel defeated. With a sigh of relief he slowly closed is eyes as the river,
birds and trees continued doing their thing.</p><p>THE END</p>
