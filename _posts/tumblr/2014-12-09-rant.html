<p>One notion that I have clear in my mind about the inhabitants of this world is that most of them are hypocrites. They are clueless about most of the stuff they claim to know about. They talk about diplomacy and then stab everyone behind their backs. They don’t know everything but they never accept it. The ones who are running this place make the ruled believe that everything is in control when they are themselves scared to their guts. It is sometimes a necessity to conceal the truth to avoid chaos. But you can’t keep them all in shadows forever. Our little ones are growing up believing that we know everything. We tell them how everything works and that our word is the final one leaving no doubt for argument. But is it bad to ask questions?</p>
<p>I know you can’t let the children do whatever they want but asking them to follow everything blindly without questioning can’t be the way. We have to stop indoctrinating them. These children grow up to become the same grown up they once loathed. This seems like a demand put forward by an anarchist. But it isn’t. Ignorance can’t be the answer. It never was. Yet we are told to incorporate a certain level of ignorance. “Certain matters are better left alone”, but are they?</p>
<p>We worry about the ozone layer depletion, and how we are harming the planet. Well this is one of the most impudent of the contemporary notions floating around. This is as cocky as you can get. Harming the earth, seriously. The universe is 13.7 billion years old. And the mother earth is floating around since 4 billion years. The first hominids came into existence around 2.5 million years back. Around 200,000 years back people started to look like the way they do now, i.e. homo sapiens evolved. We are like a speck in the timeline of the world yet we are audacious enough to say that we can harm it. We are not harming the earth, we&rsquo;re just simply making it hostile for our existence. Global warming and all these issues are quite real and simply proves that we are not as clever as we think we are. The real problem is not deforestation or global warming as far as the nature is concerned. The earth survived without us and it will continue to do so after us. This problems are just a simple example of the fact that how self destructive human race is.</p>
<p>We all talk about how far we have come since our shit slinging branch dwelling days yet we take great pleasure in demonstrating our conquest victories over fellow humans which we have achieved through brutally slaughtering them. The animal is still in us. We divide our borders and continue to demand more of them boasting our legacies and our culture and even are ready to kill and die for it. It might sound a little philosophical asking to eradicate the concept of borders and nations. Maybe it is. But we can easily draw an anology here. When a lion bless the earth with his piss encompassing an area claiming his territory. Well we are doing the same claiming our territory with blood.</p>
<p>This idea of not having any nation or boundaries might seem to be a part of some fable or fantasy. But the problems that led me to that idea are quite real. Palestinians and Israelis dying on Gaza strip. Pakistan challenging to nuke India. Jihadis always on the go. America intimidating every other nation. We are one wrong move away took by a stupid diplomat from annihilating ourselves. This is not exaggerated. This is the current state of the world we live in where most of us are eagerly waiting for a new iPhone to launch. This has always been the way. Stupid animalistic ambition of some grunt and we become an instant killing machine, ready to destroy centuries of work of art, architecture, literature and wisdom.</p>
<p>So what’s the answer? If everything is so much messed up, what to do? Well, for starters let’s be a little bit more truthful to each other. Ignorance is not a bliss apparently, and war is not the answer. People who built the atom bomb knew it but they got carried away by the patriotic notions flung at them those days. And by the time they realized it, it was too late. This is by their own account. One of the physicist working on Manhattan project who later won the Nobel prize, Richard Feynman recalls how they stopped asking questions just for the sake of accomplishing something and created something that will haunt the mankind for the generations to come.</p>
<p>Religion does not answer everything nor does science, Google comes pretty close but it has a limit as well. We need to set aside our vanity and continue our conquest of seeking new answers. We don’t need to cling on to the past but we can learn a lot from it. Let us stop imposing our notions on everybody. Let us stop destroying what is beautiful, instead learn from it and nurture it.</p>
<p>We have to accept our inability to know everything and stop acting so smug. Nobody knows how many heavens we got up there but let’s not make a hell out of our beloved home.</p>
