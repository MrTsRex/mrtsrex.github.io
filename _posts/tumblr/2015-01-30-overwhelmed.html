<p>I don’t know what I am feeling right now. I am confused. I think I have discovered a new feeling. A feeling that I have never felt before. I had always wanted to be in real jungle. To be in the lap of the nature was something that I always wanted to experience. But now that I’ve finally experienced it, it is totally a surreal feeling. Perhaps it felt surreal because it all happened so fast and it was too overwhelming for me. But I think what I always perceived a jungle to be was totally different than what it really is or maybe the reality is too real than I had expected. Right now I am sleeping in a log hut in a midst of a dense jungle and almost 30 mile away from civilization in Corbett national park. Approx 50 meters from my hut there is a fence which is placed their just to give you  a sense of security but the fence is just 4 alluminium wires on consecutive poles. It doesn’t secure us from anything. Some 50 meters away from fence there is a river running which is making all the noise there is in the almost silent crescent moon jungle. The sky looks like a illuminated blanked. There are no lights in the hut and the only source of light are the stars. I had never seen so many stars in the sky. They have provided us with solar powered portable lights but we are saving them for emergency. And I am also afraid it might attract animals, so they are turned off outside the hut. Once I am out of the fence I will be in the jungle, which will be the most horrific thing that could happen to me. Its not just the animals but the overall ambience that is making me so vulnerable. It is one of the most beautiful things my eyes have ever seen and one of the most terrible fear my heart has ever felt. I also want to be here and run away at the same time. I am both, happy to live and afraid to die. I am not afraid to die because of the death itself but because today this fear and beauty has finally made me so alive. I am almost in tears. I have discovered a new part of me today which was always their but so incomplete. Today that part is complete and I am overwhelmed. I always knew that I was emotional but today it’s like all the emotions are gone crazy and going all over the place. Perhaps the wilderness is my ultimate love but my logical mind and survival instincts are forcing myself to keep away from it.</p>
