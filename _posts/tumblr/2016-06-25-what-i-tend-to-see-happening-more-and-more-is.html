title: What I tend to see happening more and more is people retreating into their
  own corners. People seem scared to get things wrong or be shouted at so they form
  villages in which they agree with every other member, and maybe they go out and
  shout at the people in the next village for fun, but there’s no interchange of ideas
  going on. I think we have to encourage the idea that you’re allowed to think things.
  I have thought a great many stupid things over the years, and I can tell you that
  there’s not one stupid thing that I ever thought where I changed my mind because
  someone shouted at me or threatened to kill me. On the other hand, having great
  discussions with good friends, possibly over a drink, has definitely changed my
  mind and made me try to do better. You’re allowed to do better, but we have to let
  people do better.
