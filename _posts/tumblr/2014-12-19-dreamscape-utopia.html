<p>I just had another of those dreams ( or nightmare, this time I am not sure). By those dreams I do not mean any kind of “those” sexual fantasies you experience in your dreams. These are those dreams that I always fail to describe in words. I only had two of them before and just had the third one, one hour back. I am still psyched. Let me explain why I had made a different category for these dreams. It all started two or three years back. I woke up from sleep and I was so happy I couldn’t explain it to anybody. I had the dream and I was confused and happy and excited to realize the power of human imagination. What was different about this dream was it felt so real that I can still feel the chills I felt in it. This ultrareal dream made me realize what I can achieve while I am asleep. I just had the thought that maybe this is what happens when we die. We do all the stuff we want to do but in a dream place. But let’s not be morbid. Yeah so I had this dream that felt so real that made me think I really did the things that I did in the dream. But what makes this dreams so extraordinary is not just the realness or verisimilitude but that all of this dreams were concerned with the things I can only do in dreams. These were the things I always wanted to do but they were just not simply possible even if I became a billionaire. So let me tell you about the first dream. I want to give them a new name. I don’t want to insult them by calling them just dream. Let’s call them drealm for now and also the place where they takes place. So the first drealm was about a broom. Yes, a broom. But not any ordinary broom, it was a flying broom (kaboom). Like they have in harry potter. And whats more awesome is that I was flying one. It was so great I can’t find an adjective to express my emotion for that particular moment in my life in drealm. I was flying and it felt liberating. I was maneuvering the broom and taking it to places. All this happened in the open garden/ground thing in front of my house. I was with friends or harry potter characters I don’t remember exactly. But I can recall that I was flying and going places on the broom. I think many people may have had flying dreams but I don’t think that they ever had a drealm about flying. Or any drealm for that matter. But how would i know? So in the first one I was flying. There’s lot to tell but I think that I am unable to do justice to my feelings by mere words. So let’s move on to the next one until I get some proper writing lessons.

 The second one I had two months back. And this one was about dinosaurs ( dhoomkaboom). It can’t get better than this. Well it can. These dinosaurs were not fossil but real and alive. And also in a jurassic park kind of setting but only better. They were in a national park like place where they were free roaming and you can see them in their habitat. And this habitat was the colony or block I live in. It was really surreal. The drealm had two parts. In the first I was with my brother and a guide. The guide that you have to hire in Jurassic national park who drives your jeep and gives you safety info and info about the Dinos. If you can’t catch a guide, you are on your own in the park without the jeep. You can even die. The authorities are quite clumsy in the drealm. Me and my elder brother are looking at this giant parasauralopus and he is around 200 meters away from us. I always considered 7 feet Dino’s to be the small ones but when I saw one in the drealm, it was significantly big. And what made him bigger that he started rushing towards us. The guide tells us to get in the jeep and we drive off. He tells us that they do that sometimes and can knock over a jeep. We were scared. The second part has my sister in it. I go back to the park but this time with my sister. But it’s not broad daylight like in the first part but it’s dawn. We are in the park and looking for a guide and we see that lots of jeeps are there but all of them are occupied by tourists. We can’t get a guide. We are out of luck and alone. One jeep passes by and the guys in it makes creepy comments at my sister. I am furious but she asks me not to waste my energy. We are currently at a road kind of thing in the parks in the midst of a grassland. The jeeps are parked back to back and now they’re all leaving. We see that a bunch of Rajasthani nomads are coming towards us with their camels. I have no idea what they are doing in the Jurassic national park but they are there. They come closer and a woman from the bunch tells us that we shouldn’t be here alone. Like we didn’t know that. And tells us that it not safe here at night at all (surprise). It is almost night with those last beams of light. We then hear a roar and shit just gets real, i am up. I am really thankful for having these drealms. I don’t know who I should be thankful to but I am. Let’s get to the last one because its really late and I need to study. But I am not gonna rush. The past two drealms were full of thrills and goosebumps but they were not particularly dark. This one is all about dark. This is quite a nightmare but i am sure every gamer would want to be in it. It was about a zombie apocalypse (boomshabooyaahkaboom). Fuck yeah. In this I am with some of my friends in a hospital. The hospital is a dreary place as is. And if its an Indian hospital then you can be assured of nightmares. But an Indian hospital in a zombie apocalypse. Well, you are fucked. I was in a hospital during the beginning stage of the plague. People don’t know what’s going on. I have a slight idea but even I haven’t seen a zombie or anything. Everything is creepy but not chaos. It’s night time. I am with my friends. I don’t know why we are in the hospital in the first place. My friends change throughout the drealm. This kind of shit happens in a dream. It’s night time and the lights in the hospital are dimmed (stupid management). The hospital is a nice one compared to other hospitals in India. But it also has general wards for poor people. These general wards are in the basement of the hospital. The general wards in Indian hospitals are dreadful. They can fuck your childhood if you’ve been there as a kid. Its like reality thrown at your face mixed with shit. There’s nothing wrong with being poor. Well there is if you are poor. But not that you are any different. But, again, if you are Indian poor (which is really poor, poor to the limit where you can’t even have two meals a day) and diseased and in a hospital, you can’t be any more miserable than this. We are on the fourth floor of the hospital and for some reason we have to go to the basement to the general wards. We all get in the elevator and one of my friend is reluctant to get in because he is scared shitless. We try to convince him that its okay but he doesn’t listen. I push him in the lift and our decent starts. The lift suddenly stops. We think we are there. We open the two channel gates that are used in the prehistoric elevators in India ( which are still used in some of the old apartments and government and public buildings). I go out and see the entire floor is deserted. Only few light are on here and there and we can see little in front of the lift. I realize that its not the basement but the second floor. We are perplexed. We decide to go back in the lift but our friend again try to stop us or just doesn’t want to go himself. We again forcefully take him in. We go down to the basement to the general wards. We get out of the elevator and get to the corridor. We see around and find two kids. One around twelve year old and second seven or eight. The older one is a little fat wearing a shirt and pants. The little one is scrawny and wearing a shirt and knicker or half pants. They look miserable. They have something on their face and hands that tells you to stay away from them. They notice us and come near us. We see around and its dead silent. The elder kid tries to touch us. He is demanding something but we can’t make what. I try to stay away from him but he keeps coming back. We go back in elevator but the little one follows us there. We don’t want to take him up but he does not listen. We try to push him out gently but he is adamant. We decide to go out and distract the kid. We all walk out of the elevator towards the open area right of the corridor where we found the kids. The fat kid is also there. Now he also tries to come with us. He looks really scary and dirty and miserable. Something on his cheek looked like some kind of wound. I don’t want him near me. The kids try to get closer and won’t listen. I hit the elder one and my friends pushes the little one to give us time to get to the elevator. We run towards elevator knowing that they are gonna call their father or whoever they are with and its not gonna be pretty. We start running. I start imagining a heavily built man in dirty clothes coming towards us. I am scared shitless now. We hear some noise and voices. I get in the elevator. One by one all of my friends are in elevator except one. I shout to call him. He is still not there. I think of pushing the buttons but I stop. I shout again and I hear footsteps pounding on the floor. I see my friend and I drag him in swearing at him. I close the two channel gates and push the buttons on the elevator. It starts to go up slowly. We are not relieved. We suddenly see one of our lady friend come towards the elevator from the left side of the corridor with her father. We didn’t know she was here in the hospital. She gesture us to stop the elevator. We didn’t stop. We knew that if we stop something dreadful could happen. Our elevator is going up slowly and we here a scream. A scream so loud that it pierces our brain. A scream like the one a hog makes when he is being eaten alive by dogs but this one was of a human. It was so shrill that we could feel the vibrations and so loud that it was echoing in the elevator. It was more annoying than fingernails scratching against a blackboard. It was a scream that could make a grown man piss his pants. And a scream after a dead silence made it worse. We look at our friend and her father and see the fear on their faces. One of my friend ( the one who was reluctant to come) asks me, ‘are they gonna die?’. I look at him breathing heavily. I couldn’t speak.</p>
