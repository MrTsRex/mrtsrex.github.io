<hr><p>Stephen King advises that one must read and write 4 to 6 hours in a day if one expects to become a good writer. Charles Bukowski wrote a poem named <b><a href="https://allpoetry.com/So-You-Want-To-Be-A-Writer">“So you want to be a writer?”</a> </b>where he advises that one shouldn’t write if it doesn’t come naturally. Well, that looks like two different school of thoughts. And if I am not totally retarded and couldn’t comprehend the deeper or hidden meaning in these two advises, it seems as if I’ll have to listen to one of the great writer and neglect the other. We have a conflict people. A great conflict at our hand. Who to listen to? Both the writers are very accomplished and are considered good by most. They must’ve thought a lot before releasing such statements or in Mr. Bukowski’s case, writing that poem. They must’ve thought about and considered every demographic of every nation, keeping in mind every age group and financial background, right? But that would take a long, long time. That seems highly unlikely. So if these great authors haven’t done their research about the entire population of the world while stating such radical opinions, they must be totally biased, right? Well, we all are, while giving advises.</p><p>Mostly advises are not given after carefully carried out researches, but from personally experienced events. And when we give out advises, we compare our personal experience to the person seeking advice (in some cases not so much seeking but getting the advice thrown at them) and give them our two cents on the matter. And in the most cases, the advice giver has nothing but good intentions towards the advice taker. If that’s the case then there shouldn’t be anything wrong in giving out advices? Well, it’s not that simple. Our good intentions alone do not clear out our biases. The world is quite complex and doesn’t abide by any law or rule (unless, we are talking about scientific laws which it does seem to abide in our visible world but different laws in microscopic world, i.e., quantum mechanics, and then we make different theories for different scenarios to make it fit into our understanding of the world. Point being, we don’t know everything and never will). And we cannot possibly factor in all the possibilities and thus can never give a faultless advice. <br/></p><p>But that’s not the case with most of us. We churn out advises as fast as the universe is expanding (Yes it is, and humanity will die out some day and I’ll definitely die in next 80 years, and there’s no absolute meaning of life and only subjective one, i.e., the one we make out of it). And not only that, some of us even impose our advises on others and if they don’t follow, they’re either lazy or ignorant, and we can’t be possibly be wrong because of all the sufferings we have suffered and the mountains we have climbed and the books we have read and the money we have earned and the fame we have achieved. But in spite of all those achievements one can never be sure of other person’s state of events. <br/></p><p>So does that mean we shouldn’t give out advises? No, of course not. Our experiences are our most treasured possession and if we can share some of them with our brethren to help them achieve something or maybe just give them a slightly more fulfilling life, there’s nothing more noble than that. But carelessly imposing your opinions on others or just a genuine careless advice can be disastrous. Specially with highly impressionable individuals like children and me. <br/></p><p>We don’t realize what a great responsibility it is on us when someone is seeking our advice. We have to learn to say, “ I don’t know”. We have associated so much negativity with that phrase that we’ve stopped saying it altogether. I don’t know, maybe it’s just me who is too fucking impressionable that take every advice coming from a prominent or respectable human very seriously by losing my individuality. Maybe this entire rant is utterly meaningless. I don’t know.</p><p><br/></p>
