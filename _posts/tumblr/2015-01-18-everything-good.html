<p>Life is good when you can read a harry potter book and play an 8 bit video game. Memories are good. I guess memories are something that makes life good. When you remember something that makes you nostalgic, it&rsquo;s good. Reminiscence is good. Childhood is good, where everything is strange and magical and possible. Old friends are good with whom you have spent a long time. They make you remember the good old days. They make you feel trusted. New friends are good with whom you are carefree and are ready to make new memories. Friends are good. Family is good as it makes you feel wanted. It makes you feel that you are never alone in this world. Siblings are good as they know everything about you and still love you. They have gone through the good and the bad with you. They can be trusted. It is good when you can watch a 90&rsquo;s cartoon again the way you saw it the first time. Cartoons are good. Journeys are good as they teach you new lessons on every turn. They leave a mark on you. Art is good as it enables you of expressing yourself beautifully. It makes you realize that you are able of creating something beautiful and worthy. Humour is good. It can make everything pleasant.It can make the saddest situations normal and bearable. Anecdotes are good. They can turn the normal into grand and legendary. Struggle is good. It teaches you the value of good. It tells you to nurture and preserve everything good. Love is good. It makes you do the unimaginable. It is the strongest driving force. It makes you put the needs of others before yours. It makes you a better person every time it touches you. Having all these things makes you realize that life is indeed, good.</p>
